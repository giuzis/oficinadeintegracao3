## Objectives:

Bluber is an equipment that, when installed on a bicycle, allows other people to rent it. The rent can be charged through Bitcoin. Just read the QRcode through our app, the lock will open and the bike will be ready for use (within the area that its owner has defined, of course).

## Overview

### Mobile application
For users who would like to rent a bike, simply locate a bike through the app, scan the QRcode to release the lock and start pedaling (always remembering to stay within the area and speed set by the bike owner unless you want to hear a very unpleasant alarm). At the end of the race, just close the lock and take a picture of the bike to show that you left it in the same state you found it.

For users who would like to rent their bike, the app offers real-time GPS location, speed limit setting and a warning if the bike alarm goes on. In addition, you will be able to observe the photo taken after each trip to track the condition of the bike.


### Embedded System
The smart lock that is installed on the bike has GPS and GRMS so its owner always knows its location, has an alarm in case someone tries to move the bike without unlocking it and bluetooth for communication with the userâ€™s mobile phone.
